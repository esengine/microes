## UI Interaction System

- Added `Interactable` component to mark UI entities as interactive
- Added `Button` component with state machine (Normal, Hovered, Pressed, Disabled) and color transitions
- Added `UIInteraction` component tracking hover/press state (`hovered`, `pressed`, `justPressed`, `justReleased`)
- Added `UIEvents` resource with event queue — supports `click`, `press`, `release`, `hover_enter`, `hover_exit` events
- Added `UIInteractionPlugin` with hit testing against world-space `UIRect` bounds and layer-based ordering
- `createWebApp()` automatically registers the interaction plugin

## UIRect Anchor Layout

- Replaced single `anchor` field with full anchor-offset layout: `anchorMin`, `anchorMax`, `offsetMin`, `offsetMax`, `size`, `pivot`
- Added `UILayoutPlugin` that computes layout from camera bounds for `ScreenSpace` root entities and propagates through children
- Added `ScreenSpace` tag component for root UI entities that should be laid out relative to the camera
- Existing scenes automatically migrated to the new layout fields

## Addressable Assets

- Added `AddressableManifest` format with groups, addresses, labels, and asset metadata
- `AssetServer.loadByAddress(address)` — load a single asset by its address
- `AssetServer.loadByLabel(label)` — load all assets matching a label, returned as `AssetBundle`
- `AssetServer.loadGroup(groupName)` — load all assets in a group, returned as `AssetBundle`
- `AssetServer.setAddressableManifest(manifest)` — set the manifest and build address/label/group indexes
- Editor: added Addressable panel with group management, label editing, drag-move, and dependency analysis

## Asset Import Pipeline

- Added `ImporterRegistry` with type-specific import settings
- Added `TextureImporter` and `AudioImporter`
- `.meta` file format upgraded to v2.0 with automatic migration from v1

## Builder Refactoring

- Refactored build pipeline into two-stage architecture: `ArtifactBuilder` (shared build logic) + `PlatformEmitter` (platform-specific output)
- Shared build flow across all targets, platform logic cleanly separated

## Editor Improvements

- UIRect anchor preset editor with 9-point grid and 3 stretch presets
- Entity creation, deletion, and component changes now instantly sync to the running scene via Store-to-SceneManager events
- Compound commands for batched property changes

## Bug Fixes

- Batch renderer now binds white texture to all unused texture slots, fixing rendering artifacts on some GPUs
