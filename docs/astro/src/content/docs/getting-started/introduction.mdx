ESEngine is a lightweight 2D game engine with a **TypeScript SDK** powered by a **C++/WebAssembly** backend. It comes with a visual editor for scene editing and project management, and outputs games that run in web browsers and WeChat MiniGames.

## Why ESEngine?

### Visual Editor + TypeScript Scripting

Use the editor to create projects, place entities in scenes, and attach components visually. Write game logic in TypeScript — define custom components and systems that operate on scene entities:

```typescript
import { defineComponent, defineSystem, addSystem, Query, Mut, Res, Time, LocalTransform } from 'esengine';

const Speed = defineComponent('Speed', { value: 200 });

addSystem(defineSystem(
    [Res(Time), Query(Mut(LocalTransform), Speed)],
    (time, query) => {
        for (const [entity, transform, speed] of query) {
            transform.position.x += speed.value * time.delta;
        }
    }
));
```

### High Performance

Rendering and core systems are implemented in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly, delivering native-level performance with small binary sizes and fast load times.

### Cross-Platform

Single codebase targeting web browsers and WeChat MiniGames with platform-specific adapters.

## When to Use ESEngine

ESEngine is ideal for:

- 2D games targeting web browsers
- WeChat MiniGames
- Projects requiring small download sizes
- TypeScript developers wanting ECS architecture

ESEngine may not be the best choice for:

- 3D games (2D only)
- Desktop-only games (use a native engine)
