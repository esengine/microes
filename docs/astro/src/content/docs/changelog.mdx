import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Canvas & Camera Scaling

- Added `Canvas` component with 5 scale modes: FixedWidth, FixedHeight, Expand, Shrink, Match
- `designResolution` and `pixelsPerUnit` for pixel-perfect 2D layout
- `matchWidthOrHeight` blending factor for the Match scale mode
- `backgroundColor` for letterbox / pillarbox fill
- Added `Camera.showFrustum` property to visualize the camera frustum in the editor

## Fixed Timestep

- Fixed schedules (`FixedPreUpdate`, `FixedUpdate`, `FixedPostUpdate`) now execute with a 1/60s accumulator
- A single frame may trigger zero or multiple fixed steps, ensuring deterministic physics regardless of frame rate

## Modular Spine Runtime

- Spine runtime is no longer bundled in the engine core
- Standalone WASM modules `spine38` and `spine42` are loaded on demand via `SpinePlugin`
- Choose the runtime version matching your Spine editor export (`3.8` or `4.2`)

## Embedded Assets (Playable Builds)

- Added `registerEmbeddedAssets()` API to inline assets as data URIs
- The editor's Playable build pipeline uses this automatically to produce single-file output

## Unified Settings Dialog

- Merged Project Settings and Preferences into a single settings dialog

## Help Menu & Updates

- Improved Help menu with links to documentation and issue tracker
- Toast notification when a new editor version is available

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed Spine rendering on WeChat MiniGame platform
- Fixed texture packer omitting certain sprites
- Fixed default camera not being created in new scenes
- Fixed F5 preview not launching in some configurations
