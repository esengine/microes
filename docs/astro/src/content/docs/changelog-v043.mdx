import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Context Menu Registry

- Added `ContextMenuRegistry` for extension-contributed right-click menu items
- Keyboard navigation, item grouping with separators, and nested sub-menus
- Context filtering via `visible` and `enabled` callbacks
- Built-in locations: `hierarchy.entity`, `hierarchy.background`, `content-browser.asset`, `content-browser.folder`, `inspector.component`
- `registerContextMenuItem()` API for editor extensions

## Inspector Refactoring

- Refactored monolithic `InspectorPanel.ts` into focused sub-modules under `panels/inspector/`
- Added `InspectorRegistry` for custom inspector sections and component inspectors
- `registerInspectorSection()` — add collapsible sections to entity or asset inspector
- `registerComponentInspector()` — replace the default property UI for a component type with a custom inspector

## UI Component Schemas

- Added editor schemas for `Interactable` and `Button` components with property editors
- Button transition color editor with collapsible sub-section
- Hierarchy panel "Add UI" submenu for quick creation of UI entities

## Button Interaction Fixes

- Fixed `invertMatrix4` singularity threshold that rejected valid orthographic projection matrices
- Moved `InputClearSystem` from `Schedule.First` to `Schedule.Last` so pressed/released states persist for UI systems
- Fixed `ensureCamera` fallback to use orthographic projection for 2D scenes
- Added `UICameraSyncSystem` at `Schedule.First` for early camera info
- Button transition color changes now sync to runtime sprite in the editor

## Release Build Fixes

- Fixed WASM module loading failure in release builds caused by Tauri v2 nonce-based CSP blocking inline scripts — uses blob URL approach instead
- Fixed dynamic stylesheets blocked by CSP in release builds
- Fixed textures showing as white in canvas 2D fallback renderer — UUID references are now resolved to file paths
- Fixed race condition where scene could load before `AssetDatabase` finished initialization

## Tooling

- Added `build-tools/release.js` script for versioned releases with tag creation and push
- CI auto-syncs version from git tag to `tauri.conf.json`
- Resolved circular dependency in editor property modules
